# Contribute Integrations

LangChain integrations are packages that provide access to language models, vector stores, and other components that can be used in LangChain.

This guide will walk you through how to contribute new integrations to LangChain, by
publishing an integration package to PyPi, and adding documentation for it
to the LangChain Monorepo.

These instructions will evolve over the next few months as we improve our integration
processes.

## Components to Integrate

:::info

See the [Conceptual Guide](../../../concepts/index.mdx) for an overview of all components
supported in LangChain

:::

While any component can be integrated into LangChain, at this time we are only accepting
new integrations in the docs of the following kinds:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Integrate these ✅</th>
    <th>Not these ❌</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Chat Models</li>
        <li>Tools/Toolkits</li>
        <li>Retrievers</li>
        <li>Document Loaders</li>
        <li>Vector Stores</li>
        <li>Embedding Models</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>LLMs (Text-Completion Models)</li>
        <li>Key-Value Stores</li>
        <li>Document Transformers</li>
        <li>Model Caches</li>
        <li>Graphs</li>
        <li>Message Histories</li>
        <li>Callbacks</li>
        <li>Chat Loaders</li>
        <li>Adapters</li>
        <li>Other abstractions</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## How to contribute an integration

The only step necessary to "be" a LangChain integration is to add documentation
that will render on this site (https://python.langchain.com/).

As a prerequisite to adding your integration to our documentation, you must:

1. Confirm that your integration is in the [list of components](#components-to-integrate) we are currently accepting.
2. Ensure that your integration is in a separate package that can be installed with `pip install <your-package>`.
3. [Implement the standard tests](/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/standard_tests) for your integration and successfully run them.
3. Write documentation for your integration in the `docs/docs/integrations/<component_type>` directory of the LangChain monorepo.
4. Add a provider page for your integration in the `docs/docs/integrations/providers` directory of the LangChain monorepo.

Once you have completed these steps, you can submit a PR to the LangChain monorepo to add your integration to the documentation.

## Further Reading

If you're starting from scratch, you can follow the [Integration Template Guide](./from_template.mdx) to create and publish a new integration package
to the above spec.
